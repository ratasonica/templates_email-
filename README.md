Hi $contacts.name.first
 
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm glad to have the opportunity to review your concern and provide the best information.
 
Because our items are already at everyday low prices, we do not offer discount bulk purchases and we reserve the right to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers. If the order has over 30 units of same item and you paid $10000, this is considered as a bulk order.
 
Walmart.com reserves the right to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may be applicable to orders placed by the same Walmart account, the same credit card, Gift Card or checking account and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.
 
Pleas use the above criteria and take it in count for purchases in your account. I know you put your trust on Walmart.com and we strive to provide our customers with the best online experience possible. All the best for you.

Hi $contacts.name.first
 
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm always eager to support you. Unfortunately, prices and availability are subject to change without notice. Is not possible for Walmart.com to confirm the price of an item until after you ordered it. If you have the item saved on your cart for example, the order is not submitted yet; therefore, it could change on the price. I’m really sorry for the inconvenience this situation may represent to you.
 
However, if you place an order and the item change the price again to a lower price you will be able to receive a rollback. Please check the website and email us back right away so that we can honor the website price once you have an order placed.
 
I know you put your trust on Walmart.com and we strive to provide our customers with the best online experience possible. I expect this won't happen again in future.

FINANCE
AUTH ORIZATION HOLD

Incident #:
 
Hi $contacts.name.first,
 
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm glad to have the opportunity to review your concern and provide the best solution.
 
The charge you see on your account is an authorization hold. This authorization hold is not an actual charge, it just confirms that there are funds available to complete your purchase. The actual charge for the purchase amount does not occur until your order is shipped.
 
If your order is canceled or cannot be fulfilled, your bank will remove the authorization hold on your card.  While most authorization holds drop within 3 days, it can take longer, depending on your bank/credit card company.  The bank ultimately controls when this charge is released, so the best way to get the authorization hold removed early is for you to contact your financial institution.
 
For more information about authorization holds please click the link below: http://help.walmart.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/91/kw/authorization

Hi $contacts.name.first,
 
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm glad to have the opportunity to review your concern and provide the best solution.
 
I have initiated the replacement process for the 00000ITEM00000 from order number 00000ORDER0000. To complete this replacement, we need you to sign an agreement, also called an affidavit, promising that you did not receive the item.
 
I've sent an email with this agreement to your email address. If you haven't received the email, you may find your agreement in your account with the steps below:
 
1)    Sign in to "My Account"
2)    Click "Order History" and select the order and item(s) you want to return
3)    Click the link in the order to view the agreement, normally in blue letters
4)    Click Submit to agree to the agreement
 
The agreement must be signed within 7 days or your request will be canceled and your replacement will not be processed. You will receive an email with your new order number shortly after signing your agreement. As soon as your replacement order ships, you can track it online at Walmart.com by clicking "Track My Orders" at the top of our home page.
 
I know you put your trust on Walmart.com and we strive to provide our customers with the best online experience possible. I feel disappoint when we've failed to reach that goal and I expect this won't happen again in future.
 
Sincerely,

Our records indicate that the item has not been registered as returned yet. Unfortunately, there're no records of any return on our system. Trying to retrieve the return tracking number from FedEx, USPS and other carriers that work with us was unsuccessful.
 
It would be my pleasure to update the information in the system and stop the recharge to your original payment method. I just need you to provide the correct return tracking information. After we have verified that the item was actually returned and we’re able to track it, we can take care right away.
 
Otherwise, it's recommended for you to dispute the charges with your financial institution. Hopefully this won’t be the case and I expect we can resolve this with your help and without a major complication. Feel free to reply at any moment with the information requested to further assist you.

To complete your return, it's recommended for you to go back to the store and request to complete the return by them directly with a refund or replacement accordingly to your needs.

Your item is in "Backorder" status. Backorder means the item is not available at your nearest fulfillment center and our system is checking to see if any other shipping or fulfillment centers have that item in stock to complete your order.
 
We are normally dealing with a time frame of 3 to 10 days. It's recommended for you to wait for up to 10 days to have your order shipped. However, after 10 days the system automatically cancels the order.
 
If you are unable to wait, you may cancel the order and reorder a similar item or try to use a different shipping method. To attempt to cancel your order please follow these steps below:
 
1.    Sign in to "My Account"
2.    Find the order you wish to cancel
3.    Click the order number to see the order details
 
If there is no Cancel button next to the order in "My Account", please contact us so that we can take care.

While estimated delivery dates are shown on product pages and in your cart, the most accurate delivery estimate is shown in checkout after you've entered your shipping address and selected a shipping method. This is always just an estimated and the actual expected delivery date is handled by the carrier. Accordingly to the carrier’s tracking number, your order should be delivered on 0000DATE000.
 
However, I must recognize that not receiving an order within the promised time frame is totally unacceptable and is our responsibility to take any necessary. We will be investigation on this delay and providing feedback to improve our service. Also, I’ve issued a partial refund for $000AMOUNT000 for the shipping charges. Hopefully this will help us to amend this situation, please wait for the partial refund to be post on your original payment method in no more than 7 days.

SUCK IN PROCESSING MIO 

Hi $contacts.name.first,
 
Thank you for contacting walmart.com. I'm sorry to learn you haven't received your order yet. Actually, I have carefully gone through our records and have determined that your order did not process properly due to a problem with our system. Because this order was not going to be processed successfully, a request to cancel has been placed for it.
 
Please allow up to 48 hours to process this request. At some point during this time period, you should receive an email confirming the updated status of your order. Once your order successfully cancels your bank will remove the authorization hold on your card, and the credit will be back to the original payment method within 7 business days. 

 If you still need the item, you may reorder it online if available (IF ITEM IS AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE). We'll do our best to process your new order without problems and I really hope you give us another opportunity.
